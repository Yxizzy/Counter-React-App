This is a simple counter app created using react js.

First created the index.js and index.html files

Installed httpster globally as an administrator by running sudo npm install -g httpster. This allows me to serve my applications on any server from any location.

To start the application, I ran httpster -d ./dist -p 3000
-d for directory, -p for port

JSX is not recognized by the browser, so when we run this, we would get a syntax error, unexpected token. The best solution is to install a babel transpiler.# Counter-React-App
